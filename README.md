# Logistic Regression

## Introduction

This is a supervised classification regression model where I implemented **logistic regression** and applied it to two different datasets.

The types of regressions are:

- ## Simple Logistic Regression

- ## Logistic Regression with Regularization

## [Open Notebook](Logistic_Regression.ipynb)

## Data

The file `ex2data1.csv` and `ex2data2.csv` contains the dataset for our linear regression problem.
